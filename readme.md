# HTML Template parser v2 ( incomplete )

a simple template markup parse to use within your html
to build dynamic html content

this parser searches the body container of the html document for a
"templates" template element and extracts the inner templates.

```html
<templates id="templates">
	<!-- Hi im a test template -->
	<template template-id="test-template">
		<p>Test Content</p>
	</template>
</template>
```

marker are now rules which describe a certain request to the parser.<br>
a rule looks like the following

```
{{ request operator: value }}
```

the rule can be written in different ways wheres every writing
in other inpretation results.

---

## [ request ]
request have different meaning depending on the value

#### # marker
marker are request without any functionalities
they are just being replaced by the value defined in the given markup<br>
marker requests look like the following

```html
{{ marker }}
```

#### # single commands
single commands are a oneline command and are being replaced
by the parsed content from the command function<br>
single commands look like the following

```html
{{ command: value }}
```

#### # area commands
area commands are commands which affect more than its initial rule.
They look like the following

```html
{{ command start: value }}
/* html content */

An operator has an effect on the outcome of content the command creates.
More under "operator" functions.

the value is important for commands to know which index to use in the
markup. When no value is given no content will be created.

# Commands

## [ foreach ]
foreach is like the foreach you know. It loops through the defined markup
value and parses every single item.

```html
<!-- template -->
<template template-id="fruit_template">
	{{ foreach start: fruits }}
		<p>{{ fruit }}</p>
	{{ foreach end: fruits }}
</template>
```

```javascript
// markup
var markup = {
	"fruits": [
		{ "fruit": "apple" },
		{ "fruit": "orange" },
		{ "fruit": "banana" }
	]
}

var parser = require ("./parser").parser;
var content = parser.parse( "fruit_template", markup );
```

```html
<!-- result -->
<p>apple</p>
<p>orange</p>
<p>banana</p>
```
